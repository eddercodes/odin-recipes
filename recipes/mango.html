        <img src="mangonada.jpg">

        <p>When the summer sun screams across Mexico's city streets and
            sandy beaches, mangonadas come to the rescue. Also called chamangos, they can be
            made with any combination of mango sorbey, chopped fresh mango or mango puree.
            They may or may not be spiked, but they'll always contain the salty,
            spicy and tangy glavors of Tajin and chamoy. Tajin, a chile-lime salt,
            is a delicious addition to sweet and savory foods alike. Its sister condiment,
            chamoy, is traditionally made from fermented fruit, salt, sugar and chiles.
            Depending on your location, you can find Tajin, chamoy and tamaring straws - 
            their sour, chewy coating adds an extra tickle of tartness - at supermarkets
            or Latin American grocers; all three are available online.
