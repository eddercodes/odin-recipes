        <h1>Odin Recipes</h1>
        <p>Hello! And welcome to my Odin Recipes HTML project.
            I have collected for you a three-course offering around the themes
            of latin heat, asian heat, and american heat. 
        </p>

        <p>This first recipe can be cut into quarters to present a delicious and 
            refreshing appetizer. I'm talking about this 
            <a href="recipes/katsu.html">Chicken Katsu Sandwich</a> baby! These classic 
            Louisianna flavors are given a crunchy twist with the addition of 
            Japanese Panko crumbs.</p>

        <p>Next is our main course! A hot and spicy <a href="recipes/eggplant.html">Braised 
            Eggplant Noodles</a> The kick here comes from the addition of Korean hot 
            pepper paste, Gochujang, which is also used in the preparation of kimchi. 
            Watch out!</p>

        <p>Finally, we're  cooling off with a trip to Mexico. This tangy 
        <a href="recipes/mango.html">Mangonada</a> is the perfect way to end our promenade
        around the culinary globe. Enjoy the contrast of cold and hot with this tasty
        frozen treat that can also be served as a smoothie! </p>
