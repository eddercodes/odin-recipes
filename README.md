# odin-recipes
In this project I have created a brutalist website that stores several different recipes.
The object of this effort is to showcase what I have learned so far in HTML.
The process was more complex than I thought and I couldn't help but to complicate it further
by adding sublists on sublists into my code but the finished product I think is a fun meal
that could be broken into seperate weeknights or one three course dinner. Bon Appetit.
