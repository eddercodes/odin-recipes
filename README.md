# odin-recipes
In this project I have created a brutalist website that stores several different recipes.
The object of this effort is to showcase what I have learned so far in HTML.
I will use links, lists, and images to create a fluid surfing experience. 
And who knows, maybe you'll pick up a recipe or two.
